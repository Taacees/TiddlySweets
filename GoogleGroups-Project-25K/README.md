## phaseZero (Battlefield):

1. [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh3C3gr79VC1UxmXoGtaTyU1iPaw_WJg_)
    * Sometimes it's good to watch the battlefield of your next war: this was fun to creat, fun to watch BUT totally useless & waste of time (almost :wink:)
2. Travel 16 Years back in time in just 3 Hours.


## phaseOne (Bloody Duel):

* Step 01 (Done)
   * Go through all ~820 pages (all has the same URL) and get the 25K IDs and URLs for each indevidual conversation.
   * As of Today 06Aug2021, we successfully have the 24542 ID & URL. [check this Video](https://youtu.be/UJt4tYNybfs).
   * Today I can see that "we really can do it" it's hard but possible
   * Phase01 samples: https://bit.ly/37ELoj1

* Step 02 (Inprogress)
   * Collect the remaing conversations data to construct the first Data Unit/Entity in the project, which represent the "Conversation" (No "Message" are involved in this step)



## General Notes:
* Update algorithm : How to update the list without reading all 25K, for now; if there is a sequance of 1000 unchanged conversation, so we are pretty sure that the 25000 are not changed ... the udpate list is a "To Do Task" for the next phases, as it's unpractical to use the same techniqe that we use in creating the list to update it
